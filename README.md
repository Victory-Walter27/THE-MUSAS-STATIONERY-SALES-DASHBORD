**Exporatory Data Analysis**

This includes providing a solid foundation for more in-depth strategic analysis and informed decision-making.

**1. Data Overview and High-Level Metrics:**
   
   - Total Gross Income: $19,627.88 - This is the top-line revenue generated. It's a healthy figure, but needs context from costs and profitability.
   - Cumulative Cost: $873.27 - Represents the total cost incurred. This seems relatively low compared to gross income, which is a positive indicator for gross margins.
   - Total Units Sold: 2121 - Provides volume context. An average selling price per unit can be derived ($19,627.88 / 2121 units = ~$9.25/unit). This average price can be a benchmark for new product introductions or pricing strategies.

Initial Thoughts/Hypotheses:

- The business appears to have a good gross profit margin given the high gross income relative to cumulative cost.
- The average unit price suggests a mix of low-cost, high-volume items and potentially some higher-value items.
