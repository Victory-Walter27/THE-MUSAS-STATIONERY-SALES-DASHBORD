# THE-MUSAS-STATIONERY-SALES-DASHBORD
This sales dashboard gives a clear summary of revenue, costs, and sales performance by salesperson, region, and product.

**Exporatory Data Analysis**

This includes providing a solid foundation for more in-depth strategic analysis and informed decision-making.

**1. Data Overview and High-Level Metrics:**
   
   - Total Gross Income: $19,627.88 - This is the top-line revenue generated. It's a healthy figure, but needs context from costs and profitability.
   - Cumulative Cost: $873.27 - Represents the total cost incurred. This seems relatively low compared to gross income, which is a positive indicator for gross margins.
   - Total Units Sold: 2121 - Provides volume context. An average selling price per unit can be derived ($19,627.88 / 2121 units = ~$9.25/unit). This average price can be a benchmark for new product introductions or pricing strategies.

Initial Thoughts/Hypotheses:

- The business appears to have a good gross profit margin given the high gross income relative to cumulative cost.
- The average unit price suggests a mix of low-cost, high-volume items and potentially some higher-value items.

**2. Trend Analysis: Sales Year by Revenue & Forecast:**

   - 2014 Revenue: $9,258.34
   - 2015 Revenue: $10,369.54
     
Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth (2014 to 2015): (($10,369.54 - $9,258.34) / $9,258.34) * 100% = ~12.00% growth

Observations:

- A clear positive trend in revenue from 2014 to 2015. This indicates business growth.
- The line graph for "Sales Year by Revenue" shows a generally upward slope, reinforcing the growth.
- The "Forecast by Sales Year and Revenue" chart seems to show actuals (blue) largely meeting or slightly exceeding forecasts (green).
  
Insights & Hypotheses:

- The 12% growth is a strong indicator of a healthy, expanding business.
- What drove this growth? Was it increased unit sales, higher pricing, entry into new markets/regions, or new product introductions?
- The accurate forecasting suggests a good understanding of market dynamics or a conservative forecasting approach. A deeper dive into forecast variance (actual vs. forecast deviation) would be beneficial.

**3. Sales Representative Performance Analysis**

- Top 4 Reps by Revenue: Parent ($3,102), Krivell ($3,109), Jardine ($2,812), Jones ($2,363)
- Bottom 3 Reps by Revenue: Andrews ($438), Howard ($537), Sorvino ($1,284)
  
Observations:

- There's a significant performance gap among sales representatives. Parent and Krivell are the top performers, accounting for a substantial portion of overall revenue.
- Andrews and Howard are significantly underperforming, with revenue less than a quarter of the top performers.
- The revenue distribution among reps is skewed; a few top performers drive a disproportionately large share of sales.
  
Insights & Hypotheses:

- Talent Concentration: The business heavily relies on its top sales talent. This is a strength but also a risk if these individuals leave.
Performance Disparity: This large gap warrants immediate investigation.

Hypotheses:
- Are low performers (Andrews, Howard) assigned to less lucrative territories?
- Do they lack specific training in product knowledge or sales techniques?
- Are there external factors impacting their sales (e.g., specific market conditions, competition)?
- Could there be a data quality issue for these reps (e.g., sales not properly attributed)?

Actionable Insight: Implement a "best practices" sharing program from top performers. Provide targeted coaching and development for underperforming reps. Consider re-evaluating territory assignments or sales targets.

**4. Product/Item Performance Analysis**

- Top Item by Revenue: Binder ($9,578) - Almost 50% of the listed item revenue.
- Other Key Items: Pen Set ($4,170), Pencil ($2,135), Pen ($2,045), Desk ($1,700)
  
Observations:

- "Binder" is the clear superstar product, generating almost half of the total revenue from listed items.
- There's a significant drop-off in revenue from "Binder" to the next best-selling item, "Pen Set."
- "Desk" is the lowest revenue-generating item.
  
Insights & Hypotheses:

- Product Dependency: The business appears heavily reliant on "Binder" sales. While good, this can be a risk if demand shifts or competition intensifies.
- Pricing Strategy: Is "Binder" priced optimally? Could its price be slightly increased without impacting volume given its popularity?
- Cross-selling/Upselling: Are there opportunities to bundle "Binder" with "Desk" or "Pen" to boost sales of lower-performing items?
- Marketing Focus: Marketing efforts should heavily promote "Binder" while exploring new strategies for "Desk" and "Pen."
  
Hypotheses:

- Is "Binder" a high-margin product? (Dashboard shows revenue, not profit by item).
- Are "Desk" and "Pen" facing stiff competition or a lack of market demand?
- Do "Desk" and "Pen" require a different sales approach or target audience?
